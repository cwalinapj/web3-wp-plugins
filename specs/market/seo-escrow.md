Create:

specs/market/seo-escrow.md

Put the full logic here:
	•	job lifecycle states
	•	what “success” means (the metric)
	•	what counts as “owner approval”
	•	time windows (baseline/evaluation, dispute period)
	•	payout paths:
	•	SUCCESS → pay SEO
	•	FAIL → refund user
	•	TIMEOUT / NO-SHOW → refund user
	•	OWNER CANCEL before apply → refund user
	•	optional: platform fee

This is where you write:
“If rankings don’t improve, user receives funds back; SEO accepts job at offered amount and only gets paid on success.”

Also add:

docs/ops/seo-market.md

Plain-English version for users/admins.
